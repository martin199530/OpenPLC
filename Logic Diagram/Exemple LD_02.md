## Exemple LD_02

In this example you have **three contacts** (C-1, C-2, C-3) and **three coils** (Q-1, Q-2, Q-3). Initially all of the contacts and coils will be **OFF**. Now we put contact (C-1 & C-2) "**ON**" by that coil (Q-1 & Q-2) will go "**ON**". After contact (C-3 & C-2) is "**ON**" coil (Q-1)  will go **OFF** and Coil (Q-3) will go **ON**
